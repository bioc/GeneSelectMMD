gsMMD			Gene selection based on a mixture of marginal 
			distributions. Input is an eSet. The function will 
			obtain initial gene cluster memebership by its own.
gsMMD.default		Gene selection based on a mixture of marginal 
			distributions. Input is a data matrix. The function 
			will obtain initial gene cluster memebership 
			by its own.
gsMMD2			Gene selection based on a mixture of marginal 
			distributions. Input is an eSet. The user needs to
			input initial gene cluster memebership.
gsMMD2.default		Gene selection based on a mixture of marginal 
			distributions. Input is a data matrix. The user 
			needs to input initial gene cluster memebership.
errRates		Calculating FDR, FNDR, FPR, and FNR for a real 
			microarray data set based on the mixture of
			marginal distributions.
plotHistDensity		Plot of histogram of pooled gene expression levels,
			composited with density estimate based on the
			mixture of marginal distributions. The density
			estimate is based on the assumption that the 
			marginal correlations between subjects
			are zero.
obtainResi		Replace expression levels by the residuals of 
			regression analysis to remove the confounding effects.
